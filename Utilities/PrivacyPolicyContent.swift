Estimator Pro is designed for contractors, not data brokers. This app stores your information so you can manage jobs, clients, estimates, and invoices more efficiently.

1. Data we store

Company details (name, address, phone, email)

Client information (names, contact details, notes)

Job, estimate, and invoice data (descriptions, prices, dates)

All of this data is stored on your device and/or in your chosen backup service depending on how your device is configured.

2. How your data is used

Your data is used only to power features inside Estimator Pro, such as:

Creating and updating estimates and invoices

Linking jobs to clients

Generating totals and summaries

We do not sell your data, rent it, or use it for advertising.

3. Sync, backup, and third-party services

If you enable device backup or cloud sync, your data may be stored and backed up by those services under their own privacy policies.

If you choose to connect integrations in the future (for example, calendar or email), only the minimum necessary data will be shared to make those features work.

4. Security

Sensitive business data is stored using the system’s secure storage mechanisms where appropriate.

You are responsible for protecting access to your device (password, Face ID, Touch ID, etc.).

Do not share screenshots or exported files with anyone you do not trust.

5. Your choices

You can:

Edit or delete clients, jobs, estimates, and invoices from within the app

Delete the app from your device at any time (this removes local data that is not backed up elsewhere)

6. Changes to this policy

This privacy policy may be updated over time as new features are added. Updated versions will be included in the app.

7. Contact

If you have questions or concerns about privacy or data handling in Estimator Pro, contact your company’s administrator or the app developer using the email listed on the App Store page.
